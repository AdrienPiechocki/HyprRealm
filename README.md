# HyprRealm

HyprRealm is an open-source video game that runs in your Hyprland wallpaper\
You can interact with the game using Hyprland's submaps system\

**(WIP)** The game itself consists in a virtual space/home where you can interact with your surroundings to launch apps, read books or videos. It is a 3D first person game.

Feel free to hack the game and make it your own! [Source code availiable here](https://github.com/AdrienPiechocki/HyprRealm-godot)
